                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>Adele turned heads on Sunday night as she stepped out to attend Jay-Z and Beyoncé's star-studded Oscars afterparty. The Hello hitmaker looked incredible as she posed for a picture with TV journalist Kinga Rusin on the night, which was posted on the Daily Mail's website. The star was dressed in a form-fitting pink leopard print dress, which cinched in at the waist to showcase the star's slim figure. Adele looks sensational with her auburn hair styled in a chic up-do, and accessorised with oversized hoops, while her makeup consisted of a smoky eye and defined brow. Other A-listers in attendance at the event, held at Chateau Marmont, included Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, Reese Witherspoon and Jessica Alba.</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p3.1.jpg"><p>Adele looked incredible at the Oscars afterparty</p></p>
                        <p>The star has lost an impressive seven stone after transforming her lifestyle, and has been making headlines as a result. While she has been keeping a low profile, the mother-of-one was pictured over Christmas on holiday in the Caribbean, where she looked slimmer than ever. The award-winning singer is said to have shed seven stone after changing her diet and working out regularly. Her former personal trainer, Camilla Goodis, gave an insight into how she lost the pounds while chatting on Lorraine in January. "She's working out but I think 90 per cent of it is diet," she told host Lorraine Kelly. "It's a good diet to shed the weight. The first week is intense, green juices and only 1,000 calories. She doesn't look too thin – she looks amazing."</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p3.2.jpg"><p>The Hello hitmaker has shed seven stone after transforming her lifestyle</p></p>
                        <p>Camila – a Pilates trainer – has trained Adele alongside Robbie Williams' wife Ayda Field. On working with the star, she added: "When she came for a work out I didn't know it was her and when she left I thought : 'Oh it looks a little bit like Adele. She looks amazing – she's changed her lifestyle and diet.'" The star is also said to have been working out with US trainer Dalton Wong over the past few months to help with her weight loss. Dalton has trained the likes of Jennifer Lawrence.</p>
                        <p>After Adele shared a photo of her slimmed-down figure on Instagram, she was inundated with messages from her followers, with one fan writing: "CONGRATULATIONS on your healthy weight/size!" while another follower told her, "Girl u look great." One fan said: "Adele looked hot anyway, now look at her!!!" Her weight loss following after her separation from husband Simon Konecki, following three years of marriage. The pair began dating in 2011, and welcomed their son Angelo, now seven, the following year.</p>
                        <p>Adele has been making sure her five-year-old son Angelo is starting early when it comes to helping out around the house, and has been encouraging him with an ingenious parenting chart. The award-winning singer revealed how her little boy is being encouraged to do chores in a new Instagram photo, which was posted to celebrate Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding. In the glamorous photo, Adele is seen raising a glass of bubbly to the happy couple while at home. And on close inspection, there is a 'Gobs of Jobs' activity chart in the background, which uses felt stars to award children for helping out with tasks such as going to bed on time and taking out the rubbish.</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p3.3.jpg"><p>Adele's parenting chart for her son can be seen in the background</p></p>
                        <p>The chart is available to buy on Crate and Barrel for £62.94, and allows for parents to set goals for their children through an assigned amount of star awards. Online the website states: "With various tasks that you can assign to family members throughout the week on a colourful felt calendar, it's an easy and fun way to keep the house running smoothly".</p>
                        <p>Adele shares her little boy husband Simon, and previously opened up about parenthood while chatting to Vogue. The doting mum said: "[Angelo] makes me very proud of myself. When I became a parent, I felt like I was truly living. I had a purpose, where before I didn’t. I can’t have any other junk in my head to worry about as well [as him]." She also thanked her son during an acceptance speech for Best Album of the Year at the Grammys in 2017, saying: "Grammys, I appreciate it, the Academy, I love you, my manager, my husband and my son – you're the only reason I do it."</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p3.4.jpg"><p>Adele is a doting mum to five-year-old Angelo</p></p>
                        <p>It's been an exciting month for Adele, who turned 30 at the beginning of the month – and she certainly knew how to celebrate in style! The singer held a Titanic movie themed party, and decided to dress up as Kate Winslet's character Rose. It looked to be a star-studded party, with Adele choosing rapper Childish Gambino to perform - and from the photographs, it looks like hit-maker Adele had a night off from the stage herself, instead taking to the dance floor!</p>
